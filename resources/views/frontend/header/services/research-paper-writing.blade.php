								First, you need to choose the topic of your own will, about which you have good knowledge and comfortable with. Your attitude reflects towards the work you choose. <br>
								And, now get the approval from the teacher and make them comprehend about your topic and understanding in nut and shell. If you are uncertain about the topic you chose rethink about it and go for explanation before introducing to the teacher. <br>
								Now, choose a subject that can be managed easily, that should not be much technical or specialized. Confront the subjects which have narrow range of source materials.
